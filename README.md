# OpenVistaAI
**Failure-Aware Career & Learning Navigator**

OpenVista AI is an AI-powered platform that helps learners avoid common failure points in learning and validate career choices early through real-world micro-internships.

Instead of only showing *what to learn*, PathPilot AI shows **where learners fail**, **why they fail**, and provides **simplified survival resources**. It also allows users to experience real job tasks in 15 minutes before committing months of effort.
